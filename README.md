# Restaurant-Order-Management-System
Title: 
Restaurant Management System 
 
• Objective: 
To design and develop a web-based Restaurant Management System that enables users to 
manage menu items, create customer orders, edit orders, delete orders, and generate detailed 
bills efficiently, improving operational management in restaurants. 
 
• Abstract: 
The Restaurant Management System is a Flask-based web application integrated with a 
MySQL database, designed to streamline restaurant operations. The application offers a user
friendly interface where users can browse the menu, place new orders, update existing orders, 
delete orders, and generate a bill summary. 
The system reduces manual management overhead, increases order accuracy, improves 
customer service speed, and provides real-time updates to the restaurant's database. The 
platform is built with a scalable architecture suitable for future expansion like adding login 
systems, online orders, and payment integration. 
 
• Technology Stack: 
Component     Technology Used 
Frontend HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 
Backend Python (Flask Framework) 
Database MySQL 
Server Flask Development Server 
Tools Visual Studio Code 
 
 
• System Architecture: 
 
1. Frontend: Provides forms and buttons for interacting with users (HTML + Bootstrap 
UI). 
2. Backend (Flask): 
o Handles user requests. 
o Connects to the database. 
o Processes business logic (create, edit, delete orders). 
3. Database (MySQL): 
o Stores menu items, customer details, orders, and billing information. 
 
• Modules Explanation: 
 
1. Landing Page :  
The entry point of the system. It displays a welcome message and provides easy navigation 
options for the user to access the Menu, Create Order, or View Orders pages. It acts as a 
centralized dashboard for the restaurant system. 
2. Menu Management : 
Displays a list of all available dishes offered by the restaurant, along with their prices and a 
brief description. This module helps customers or staff to easily view the available food options 
before placing an order. 
3. Create Order : 
Allows users to create a new customer order. The user selects one or more menu items, specifies 
the quantity for each, and submits the order. This module stores the customer's name, table 
number, selected items, and prepares the order for further processing. 
4. Edit Order : 
Provides the functionality to modify an existing order. The user can update customer details 
(name, table number) and change the items or quantities ordered. It ensures that any mistake 
or change request can be easily managed without canceling the entire order. 
5. View Orders : 
Displays a detailed table containing all orders placed so far, including order ID, customer name, 
table number, and total amount. This module helps restaurant staff to monitor and manage 
active or completed orders efficiently. 
6. Generate Bill : 
Calculates and generates a printable bill for a particular order. The bill includes the list of items 
ordered, quantities, individual and total prices, making it ready for customer billing and 
payment. 
7. Delete Order : 
Provides an option to delete an unwanted or incorrectly placed order. This module ensures that 
both the order and its associated items are completely removed from the system database to 
maintain accurate records. 
 
• Database Design: 
 
o Tables Used: 
1. menu_items (item_id, item_name, price, description) 
2. orders (order_id, customer_name, table_number, total_amount) 
3. order_items (order_item_id, order_id, item_id, quantity) 
 
o Relationships: 
1. One order can have multiple order items. 
2. Each order item is linked to a menu item. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Advantages: 
1. User-friendly web interface. 
2. Reduces manual errors in order taking and billing. 
3. Fast and efficient management of customer orders. 
4. Real-time bill generation. 
5. Easy to expand features like online ordering and payment. 
 
• Conclusion: 
The Restaurant Management System offers a lightweight, easy-to-use solution for managing 
restaurant operations digitally. By automating menu management, order processing, and 
billing, the system improves overall efficiency, reduces human error, and enhances the 
customer experience. This system can be further enhanced with login systems, payment 
integrations, and real-time inventory management.
